# 5starprocessing.info

Website with information for open processing in the web at 5starprocessing.info, and open process and reproducibility advocacy site.

Both the idea and the technical infrastructure were heavily inspired by the project http://5stardata.info by Michael Hausenblas (http://mhausenblas.info). And as he puts it: All stuff here in the Public Domain, as usual ;).
