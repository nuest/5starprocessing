	<h1>5 &#x2605; Open Geoprocessing</h1>

	<p id="about" class="narrow">
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card#i">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the inventor of the Web and Linked Data initiator, suggested a <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 star deployment scheme</a> for Open Data. These simple classification scheme was a great success for the Linked Open Data (LOD) movement because it established common terms and makes the concepts and goals easily accessible. Here, we try to transfer this success to the domain of geospatial processes in the web. We give examples for each step of the stars and explain costs and benefits that come along with it.

		Below, we provide examples for each level of the 5 star Open Geoprocess plan. The example process used throughout is '<em>the supermarkets on my way home</em>', or more technically the 100m buffer around my route from work to home that is intersected with a retail dataset of supermarkets:
